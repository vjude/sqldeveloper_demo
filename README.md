# sqldeveloper_demo
This repository demonstrates my knowledge of modeling, creating, and querying a database I created in Oracle SQL Developer.

I completed this project as part of coursework for DBST 652 provided by the University of Maryland-Global Campus while pursuing my MS degree.
This project provided beginning to end practice in creating a database per a request from a mock client. This included creating a Statement of Work,
providing an ERD, and compiling a final Technical Report. And of course, writing the DDL and DML to create and utilize the database. 

The attached DDL/DML file creates a database for a Warehouse Management System (WMS), which traces inventory levels and goods movements within a
warehouse for a mock pharmaceutical company.
